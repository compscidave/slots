Simple project created one weekend that implements a slot machine.

There is a main method in Slot.java.

Run the project as a Java Application and follow the prompt/display in console.

There are three "visible" positions on each reel.

Winning combinations only occur on the middle position.

Payout is roughly 96%

You can "bet" in increments of one, two, or three.

Starting bank is 100.

For a payout table, see the incredibly hard-to-read class Combination.java.
